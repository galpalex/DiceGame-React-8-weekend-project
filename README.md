ASSIGNMENT
React – Dice Game
The following exercise contains the following subjects:
 JSX
 Props
 State
 User Input
Instructions
We are going to create a fun dice game.
Get the starter images from here
Here is a small demo
Rules
The game has 2 players, playing in rounds.
In each turn, a player rolls 2 dices as many times as he wishes.
Each result will get added to his round’s score.
But if the player rolls a double six all his round’s score gets lost.
After that, its the next player’s turn.
A player can choose to ‘Hold’, which means that his round’s score
gets added to his global score. After that, its the next players turn.
The first player to reach 100 points wins.
Add an input field where players can set the winning score, so that
they can change the predefined score of 100.
The player can create a new game whenever they want to.
Extra:
1. Add how many times the player has won the game
2. Add local storage so our data will be persistent.
3. Add an AI to compete against
4. if you get 6 and 6 hold your event listeners for 1 second and
display a message that you got 6 and 6. Can be a funny gif or
anything you can think of.
5. Add background music and sound effects.
6. Any other additions are welcome. Go crazy!
Yalla Balagan!
